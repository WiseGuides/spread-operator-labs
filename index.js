// Spread Operator Lab
// Rev. 22Jan2019

/*
1. Create an array, composers, with elements: Bach, Beethoven, Brahms
*/

/*
2. Create a new array, myComposers, using the spread operator to incorporate the elements in composers -- and adding two new names: Berlioz and Britten
*/

/*
3. Create a function, showComposer, that accepts an array of composers and outputs each one. 
*/

/*
4. Using the code below, use the spread operator to extract the array elements of numbers and send them to greatestOfThree.

let numbers = [5,2,9];
let greatestOfThree = (num1, num2, num3) => {
  let greatest = num1;
  greatest = num2 > greatest && num2;
  greatest = num3 > greatest && num3;
  return greatest;
};
*/

/*
5. Create a JavaScript object -- you decide which keys and values should be included. Now, create a new object that starts with those key/value pairs by using the spread operator.
*/

/*
6. Reverse the strings "racecar" and "deified"
*/
